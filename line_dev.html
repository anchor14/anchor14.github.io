      <h2>나는 라인 개발자입니다 by Line Developers.</h2>
      <p>This book was recommended to me by Junghwan Park. We are both from 28th regiment 3rd battalion at Nonsan and began the army 2019/11/04. Junghwan, who is also a Software Engineering
      major handed me this book. I was first hesitant to read the book since I never properly used the service Line. I only knew it was a successful chat app outside of Korea and had more than 300M users.
      I started reading the book one night out of boredom and I am enjoying it quite a lot now.</p>
