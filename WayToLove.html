      <h2>The Way to Love by Anthony de Mello</h2>
      <p>I was supposed to give Cami the book Order of Time by Carlo Rovelli as her 23rd birthday present.
      Last second I changed my mind while watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEl2KUZ3JWA">the interview video of Sam Altman</a>
      The interview itself is great. Recommended when you have time. Anyways I thought Cami would appreciate something
      softer. And as we always share much thoughts about romance, I thought this was a great book.</p>
      <p>Funny behind story is that Cami went through a lot of hassle to pick up this book as it went to the wrong address.
      Also, I have not read this book.</p>
