      <h2>The Runaway Species: How Human Creativity Remakes the World by Anthony Brandt and David Eagleman</h2>
      <p>I went to the bookstore in the department store near the train station near my base. I was originally planning to buy another book which is the <i>The Design of Everyday Things</i> by Don Norman
      Unfortunately they did not have this book so I felt like searching another book that was intersting. I encountered this book with an interesting cover and as I flew through the pages I saw the painting
      Guernica by Picasso, one of my favorite paintings. I instantly decided to buy the book. I met corporal Chun at 2nd Operational Command. He seemed to be interested in the book when we bumped in on our way to work.
      I gave him the book on 1/31/2019. Fun fact is that both of us are from 28th regiment 3rd battalio almost exactly a year apart.</p>
