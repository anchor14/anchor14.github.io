      <h2>How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie</h2>
      <p>This is a very famous book that I have not thought of reading until it was recommended by Paul Graham
      on one of his <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/bronze.html">essays</a> about startups.
      It was the first English book I had read in a while and fun story, a water bottle exploded in my bag while this
      book was in the bag. Nikolaj commented that such is a great way of making the book look like it was read enough times.</p>
